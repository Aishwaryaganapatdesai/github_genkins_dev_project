Jenkins integration of Django Project with Docker, and SonarQube
This project is a Django application showcasing the integration of various DevOps tools to achieve a seamless development workflow. The setup includes Jenkins for continuous integration, Docker for containerization, and SonarQube for code quality analysis. Hosted on GitHub, the repository contains a .github directory with workflows for automating tasks such as running tests and deploying code. The Jenkins pipeline automates the process of cloning the repository, building the Docker image, running tests within the container, analyzing code quality with SonarQube, and deploying the application if all checks pass. Docker ensures consistency across different environments with a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for building and running containers. This integration demonstrates a robust CI/CD pipeline, maintaining high code quality and facilitating efficient development and deployment
